- [x]  Add buttons
- [ ]  Add the requirements.txt file to the repo
- [ ]  Fix the width and length of the program
- [ ]  Add color to the program
- [ ]  Make an executable release for Windows
- [ ]  Make an executable release for Linux
- [ ]  Make an executable release for MacOS

## How to run:
From source:

Executables ~are~ will be avaible on the [releases](https://github.com/root-120/gui-calculator/releases) page! (soon)
